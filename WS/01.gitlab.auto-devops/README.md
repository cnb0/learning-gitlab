# Hands-On Auto DevOps with GitLab CI 

ands-on tutorial with GitLab CI. You will use GitLab CI to create a DevOps Pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy software to virtual machines and container environments. You will explore the features of GitLab CI, including using runners to execute build jobs, creating multi-stage builds, deploying to virtualized and containerized environments, and automatically building and updating documentation with GitLab Pages.

You will see how easy it is to get started with GitLab CI by deploying your own runners in cloud environments or on your own servers, using Docker and Kubernetes or ordinary scripting. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be ready to use GitLab CI for your own application, automating your build and deployment pipeline.
